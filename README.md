# kurdi
There are some hopefully useful files/scripts/chunks etc to share with Kurdi developers. 

1. kurdi_words.txt: a list of Kurdish words (currently 33K+).
2. unicode_list.txt: list of unicode values for Kurdish alphabet (Arabic script) standard accepted and published on http://unicode.ekrg.org/ku_unicodes.html
3. ku.po for Drupal. Most of the translations come from https://localize.drupal.org/translate/languages/ku (now almost dead
4. KRG health institutions throughout KRG (see health)
